### Phuong

- reanalysed the mathematica with 2 **done**
- do the graphs for ratio of \beta
- for which parameter combinations does bistability occur and what it means.
- Birth function - impact of manipulation is on the population dynamics/epidemiology and not physiological
	- talk a bit more about the predation functions and show the connection to the birth of definitive hosts or rather the transmission functions \lambda
- **Introduction** -- differentiate between infection biology and macroparasite infections ... and differences between microparasite and macroparasitic models. 
- how much do we remove/reduce the linear system
- definitely include the suggested $\lambda$s from reviewer 1

### Chaitanya

- perhaps at the end of the introduction we mention what is repeated from previous work and where does the new contribution start.
- emphasize that we have a **free living pool** that is typically not included in the classical models
- why dont we look at evolution .. remove (we tried) - setting up the ecological model with *free living pool*
- **Introduction** -- why we do not want to look at average parasite load instead of distinct individual parasite  - *not focus too much on this* we follow convention from previous X, Y, Z papers and add the *free living pool* dynamics
