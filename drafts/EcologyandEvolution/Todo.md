## Todo

- Birth function - impact of manipulation is on the population dynamics/epidemiology and not physiological
	- talk a bit more about the predation functions and show the connection to the birth of definitive hosts or rather the transmission functions \lambda

- perhaps at the end of the introduction we mention what is repeated from previous work and where does the new contribution start.

- emphasize that we have a **free living pool** that is typically not included in the classical models

- why dont we look at evolution .. remove (we tried) - setting up the ecological model with *free living pool*

- **Introduction** -- differentiate between infection biology and macroparasite infections ... and differences between microparasite and macroparasitic models. 

- *Phuong* - how much do we remove/reduce the linear system

- definitely include the suggested $\lambda$s from reviewer 1

- **Introduction** -- why we do not want to look at average parasite load instead of distinct individual parasite  - *not focus too much on this* we follow convention from previous X, Y, Z papers and add the *free living pool* dynamics
