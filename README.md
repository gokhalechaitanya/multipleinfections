# multipleinfections

This git repository provides information to produce the manuscript "Multiple infections and complex life cycles"

The code folder contains mathematica files:

- trophicaltransmission_analytic.nb (produces analytic results of the model)

- trophicaltransmission_numerical.nb (produces numerical analysis and figures)
Reader can execute separated cells to obtain the figures or execute the whole notebook (this will take sometimes due to
heavy computation of the bifurcation graph)

- modelsetup.nb (a test to produce sketch in Mathematica)

- Tools.m (functions that are needed in the trophicaltransmission_numerical.nb)
